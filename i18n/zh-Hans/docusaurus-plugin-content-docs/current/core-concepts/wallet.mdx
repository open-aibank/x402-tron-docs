In x402-tron, a TRON wallet is both a payment mechanism and a form of unique identity for buyers and sellers. Wallet addresses are used to send, receive, and verify payments, while also serving as identifiers within the protocol.

### Role of the Wallet

#### For Buyers

Buyers use TRON wallets to:

* Store USDT/TRC-20 tokens
* Sign TIP-712 payment payloads
* Authorize onchain payments programmatically
* Manage token allowances for facilitators

Wallets enable buyers, including AI agents, to transact without account creation or credential management.

#### For Sellers

Sellers use TRON wallets to:

* Receive USDT/TRC-20 payments
* Define their payment destination within server configurations

A seller's TRON wallet address is included in the payment requirements provided to buyers.

### TRON Wallet Addresses

TRON uses base58-encoded addresses that start with 'T'. For example:
- `TDhj8uX7SVJwvhCUrMaiQHqPgrB6wRb3eG`

### Creating a Wallet Signer

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
from x402.signers.client import TronClientSigner

# From private key
signer = TronClientSigner.from_private_key(
    private_key="your-private-key",
    network="nile"  # or "mainnet", "shasta"
)

print(f"Address: {signer.get_address()}")
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">

```typescript
import { TronWeb } from 'tronweb';
import { TronClientSigner } from '@open-aibank/x402-tron';

const tronWeb = new TronWeb({
  fullHost: 'https://nile.trongrid.io',
  privateKey: 'your-private-key',
});

const signer = TronClientSigner.withPrivateKey(
  tronWeb,
  'your-private-key',
  'nile'
);

console.log(`Address: ${signer.getAddress()}`);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### TIP-712 Signing

x402-tron uses TIP-712 (TRON's implementation of EIP-712) for structured data signing. This provides:

* **Human-readable signing**: Users can see what they're authorizing
* **Domain separation**: Signatures are bound to specific contracts/domains
* **Replay protection**: Signatures include nonces and expiration

The signing flow:
1. Client receives payment requirements from server
2. Client constructs a TIP-712 typed data structure
3. Client signs the data with their private key
4. Signature is included in the `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header

### Token Allowances

For the `upto` payment scheme, clients must approve the facilitator to spend tokens on their behalf. This is done via the standard TRC-20 `approve` function.

The x402-tron client SDK handles this automatically, but you can also manage allowances manually:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
async def check_my_allowance():
    # Check if approval is needed
    allowance = await signer.check_allowance(
        token_address="TXYZopYRdj2D9XRtbG411XZZ3kM5VkAeBf",
        required_amount=1000000,
        network="nile"  # or "mainnet", "shasta"
    )

    if allowance < required_amount:
        # SDK will auto-approve when needed
        pass
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">

```typescript
// Check if approval is needed
const allowance = await signer.checkAllowance(
  'TXYZopYRdj2D9XRtbG411XZZ3kM5VkAeBf',
  BigInt(1000000),
  'nile'  // or 'mainnet', 'shasta'
);

// SDK will auto-approve when needed
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Network-Specific Endpoints

TRON full nodes / API endpoints for each network:

| Network | Endpoint |
|---------|----------|
| Mainnet | `https://api.trongrid.io` |
| Nile (Testnet) | `https://nile.trongrid.io` |
| Shasta (Testnet) | `https://api.shasta.trongrid.io` |

### Security Best Practices

* **Never expose private keys**: Use environment variables for key storage
* **Use testnet for development**: Test on Nile or Shasta before mainnet
* **Limit allowances**: Only approve the amount needed for payments
* **Monitor transactions**: Track payments and allowances on TronScan

### Summary

* TRON wallets enable programmatic, permissionless payments in x402-tron.
* Buyers use wallets to pay for services via TIP-712 signed authorizations.
* Sellers use wallets to receive payments.
* Wallet addresses also act as unique identifiers within the protocol.
* The SDK handles token allowances automatically.

description: "This guide walks you through integrating with **x402-tron** to enable payments for your API or service on TRON blockchain. By the end, your API will be able to charge buyers and AI agents for access."

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

**Note:** This quickstart begins with testnet configuration (TRON Nile) for safe testing. When you're ready for production, see [Running on Mainnet](#running-on-mainnet) for the simple changes needed to accept real payments on TRON mainnet.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

* A TRON wallet to receive funds (any TRON-compatible wallet)
* Python 3.10+ and pip installed (for Python SDK)
* Node.js 18+ and npm installed (for TypeScript SDK)
* An existing API or server

### 1. Install Dependencies

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python (FastAPI)">
    Install the x402-tron Python package with FastAPI support:

    ```bash
    pip install x402-tron[fastapi]
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">
    Install the x402-tron TypeScript package:

    ```bash
    npm install @open-aibank/x402-tron tronweb
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Add Payment Middleware

Integrate the payment middleware into your application. You will need to provide:

* The Facilitator URL. For testing, run your own local facilitator or use a hosted one.
* The routes you want to protect.
* Your TRON receiving wallet address.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python (FastAPI)">
    Full example in the demo repo [here](https://github.com/open-aibank/x402-tron-demo/tree/main/python/server).

```python
import os
from fastapi import FastAPI
from x402.server import X402Server
from x402.fastapi import x402_protected
from x402.facilitator import FacilitatorClient
from x402.config import NetworkConfig

app = FastAPI()

# Your TRON receiving wallet address
PAY_TO_ADDRESS = "TDhj8uX7SVJwvhCUrMaiQHqPgrB6wRb3eG"

# Facilitator URL (run locally or use hosted)
FACILITATOR_URL = "http://localhost:8001"

# Initialize x402 server (TRON mechanisms auto-registered)
server = X402Server()
facilitator = FacilitatorClient(base_url=FACILITATOR_URL)
server.add_facilitator(facilitator)

@app.get("/protected")
@x402_protected(
    server=server,
    price="1 USDT",  # 1 USDT = 1000000 (6 decimals)
    network=NetworkConfig.TRON_NILE,
    pay_to=PAY_TO_ADDRESS,
)
async def protected_endpoint():
    return {"data": "secret content"}


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Route Configuration:**

When configuring protected routes, you specify:

* **price**: Payment amount (e.g., "1 USDT", or raw amount like "1000000")
* **network**: TRON network identifier (e.g., `tron:nile`, `tron:mainnet`)
* **pay_to**: Your TRON wallet address to receive payments

When a request is made to these routes without payment, your server will respond with the HTTP 402 Payment Required code and payment instructions.

### 3. Run a Facilitator

x402-tron requires a facilitator to verify and settle payments. You can run your own:

```bash
# Clone the demo repository first
git clone https://github.com/open-aibank/x402-tron-demo.git
cd x402-tron-demo/python/facilitator

# Configure environment variables (copy .env.example to .env and set your keys)
cp .env.example .env

python main.py
```

This starts a facilitator on `http://localhost:8001` with endpoints:

* `GET /` - Service info
* `GET /supported` - Supported capabilities
* `POST /verify` - Verify payment payload
* `POST /settle` - Settle payment on-chain
* `POST /fee/quote` - Get fee quote

### 4. Test Your Integration

To verify:

1. Make a request to your endpoint (e.g., `curl http://localhost:8000/protected`).
2. The server responds with a 402 Payment Required, including payment instructions in the `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header.
3. Complete the payment using a compatible client. This typically involves signing a TIP-712 payment payload, which is handled by the client SDK detailed in the [Quickstart for Buyers](quickstart-for-buyers).
4. Retry the request with the `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header containing the signed payment payload.
5. The server verifies the payment via the facilitator and, if valid, returns your actual API response.

### 5. Error Handling

* If you run into trouble, check out the examples in the [demo repo](https://github.com/open-aibank/x402-tron-demo) for more context and full code.
* Ensure the facilitator is running and accessible
* Check that your TRON wallet address is valid

## Running on Mainnet

Once you've tested your integration on testnet (Nile), you're ready to accept real payments on TRON mainnet.

### 1. Update Network Configuration

Change from testnet to mainnet:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
from x402.config import NetworkConfig

# Testnet → Mainnet
network=NetworkConfig.TRON_MAINNET  # was TRON_NILE
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Update Your Facilitator

If running your own facilitator:

1. Update environment variables to use mainnet credentials
2. Ensure the facilitator wallet has TRX for energy/bandwidth fees
3. Update the facilitator network configuration

### 3. Update Your Wallet

Make sure your receiving wallet address is a real mainnet address where you want to receive USDT payments.

### 4. Test with Real Payments

Before going live:
1. Test with small amounts first
2. Verify payments are arriving in your wallet
3. Monitor the facilitator for any issues

**Warning:** Mainnet transactions involve real money. Always test thoroughly on testnet first and start with small amounts on mainnet.

## Network Identifiers

x402-tron uses simple network identifiers:

| Network | Identifier |
|---------|------------|
| TRON Mainnet | `tron:mainnet` |
| TRON Nile Testnet | `tron:nile` |
| TRON Shasta Testnet | `tron:shasta` |

See [Network Support](../core-concepts/network-and-token-support) for the full list.

### Next Steps

* Check out the [demo examples](https://github.com/open-aibank/x402-tron-demo) for more complex payment flows
* Explore [Core Concepts](../core-concepts/http-402) to understand how x402-tron works
* Get started as a [buyer](quickstart-for-buyers)

### Summary

This quickstart covered:

* Installing the x402-tron SDK
* Adding payment protection to your API endpoints
* Running a facilitator for payment verification and settlement
* Testing your integration on testnet
* Deploying to TRON mainnet

Your API is now ready to accept TRON-based payments through x402-tron.
